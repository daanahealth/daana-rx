## Recommendations

### Ongoing Security Maintenance

1. **Regular Audits**: Run `npm audit` weekly

   ```bash
   npm audit
   ```

2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies current

   ```bash
   npm outdated  # Check for updates
   npm update    # Update to latest compatible versions
   ```

3. **Automated Monitoring**: Consider using:
   - Dependabot (GitHub)
   - Snyk
   - npm audit in CI/CD pipeline

### Development Best Practices

1. **Pre-commit Checks**: Add to git hooks

   ```bash
   npm audit && npm run build
   ```

2. **CI/CD Integration**: Add security checks to pipeline
   - Run `npm audit` on every PR
   - Fail builds if high/critical vulnerabilities found

3. **Regular Updates**: Schedule monthly dependency reviews
